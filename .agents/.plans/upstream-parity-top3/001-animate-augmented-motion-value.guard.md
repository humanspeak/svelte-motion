# Guard log — 001 Re-type `animate` for AugmentedMotionValue

Running oversight log for plan 001. One entry per checkpoint, append-only.

---

## Checkpoint 2026-07-08 — `guard parity 1`

- **Verdict**: ON TRACK
- **Snapshot**: `65ef75f` (plan-001 code) — reviewed against base `45203c4`
  (branch `fix/animate-augmented-motion-value-typing`).
- **Plan `Planned at`**: `634983b`. Drift check
  (`git diff 634983b..HEAD -- src/lib/index.ts augmentMotionValue.svelte.ts effects.ts animate.svelte.ts`)
  showed no out-of-scope source moved under the plan's assumptions.

### Done criteria (re-run, not trusted)

| Criterion                                             | Result                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm check` (root) exit 0                            | PASS — 0 errors, 32 pre-existing warnings; `@ts-expect-error` cases validated |
| `pnpm test` incl. `animateValue.spec.ts`              | PASS — 3/3                                                                    |
| `grep as unknown as RawMotionValue src/ docs/src` → 0 | PASS — 0 (one doc-comment mention only)                                       |
| `pnpm --filter docs check` exit 0                     | FAIL — 10 errors, all pre-existing/unrelated (see Finding 1)                  |
| e2e suites                                            | DEFERRED to `final`; runtime identity proven below                            |
| README status row updated                             | PASS — 001 → DONE                                                             |

### Evidence

- `src/lib/utils/animateValue.ts:91` — `export const animate = animateCore as SvelteMotionAnimate`:
  pure type-level cast, no runtime wrapper. Spec asserts `animate === animateCore`
  (`animateValue.spec.ts:23`) → zero runtime change. Matches `effects.ts` exemplar;
  value overloads precede the object-target overload (`animateValue.ts:34-63`).
- `src/lib/index.ts:44` — `animate` moved out of the raw `from 'motion'` block into
  `$lib/utils/animateValue`. `src/lib/utils/animate.svelte.ts` — `useAnimate` scoped
  animate re-typed to `SvelteMotionAnimate`.
- All 10 cast-site diffs read: pure `as unknown as RawMotionValue` + unused-import
  removal, no logic changes, no weakening to `any`.
- Spec genuinely asserts (target-reaching `mv.get()` → 100/1; `@ts-expect-error`
  negatives) — not gamed.

### Finding 1 — PLAN DEFECT (criterion 4 unachievable) — NOT YET AMENDED

`pnpm --filter docs check` cannot exit 0: all 10 errors pre-date this plan and are
unrelated (`shadcn/ui/tabs`, `use-animation-controls`, `paraglide/server.js`,
`vite.config.ts`, `transform-template`'s `TransformTemplate`). None are in the 5
touched examples (verified 0 each); the wrapper in fact removed 5 pre-existing
animate-typing errors (docs 15 → 10). Executor correctly did not touch out-of-scope
files to force it green. Recommended amendment (pending operator agreement): scope
criterion 4 to "introduces no new docs-check errors in touched files."

### Finding 2 — out-of-scope items present (flag only; not drift, not tampering)

`005-ai-glow-border-example.md` + `assets/ai-glow-prototype.html` are maintainer-
authored (separate P2 plan), not executor output. Committed separately as `13c69be`.
No evidence the executor edited the plan or this log.

### Next

- Amend criterion 4 on operator agreement, then re-stamp `Planned at` + log `PLAN AMENDED`.
- `guard parity 1 final` to run the e2e regression gate and open the PR.

## Checkpoint 2026-07-08 — `guard parity 1 final`

- **Verdict**: NO-PASS (single blocker — plan defect on criterion 4; see report)
- **Snapshot**: `65ef75f` (unchanged; tree clean at gate time).
- **Done criteria (re-run at gate)**: 1 PASS (`pnpm check` 0 errors), 2 PASS
  (spec 3/3), 3 PASS (0 casts), 4 FAIL (`docs check` 10 pre-existing/unrelated
  errors), 5 PASS (**e2e 123 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** — the deferred runtime
  gate, incl. a fresh package build), 6 PASS (scope audit exact: `45203c4...65ef75f`
  = in-scope only), 7 PASS (README 001→DONE).
- **Decision**: work is faithful to intent with zero runtime change (e2e + identity
  test). Sole failure is the criterion-4 plan defect; guard did NOT amend (no operator
  agreement) and did NOT open a PR. Close-out report written:
  `001-animate-augmented-motion-value.guard-report.md`.
- **Flip to PASS**: operator agrees to amend criterion 4 → guard amends plan,
  re-stamps `Planned at`, logs `PLAN AMENDED`, flips report to PASS, opens PR.
