## Status

- **Priority**: P1
- **Effort**: M
- **Risk**: MED
- **Depends on**: none
- **Category**: direction (upstream parity)
- **Planned at**: commit `af90f5a`, 2026-07-09 (re-stamped on the 2026-07-09 revision;
  originally `634983b`, 2026-07-08)
- **Issue**: <https://github.com/humanspeak/svelte-motion/issues/435>

## Why this matters

Upstream framer-motion lets a `MotionValue` drive any SVG presentation attribute:
`<motion.circle cx={x} />`, scroll-linked progress rings via `r`/`stroke-dashoffset`,
animated chart lines via `x1/y1/x2/y2/points`. In svelte-motion, only the three
path-drawing props (`pathLength`/`pathOffset`/`pathSpacing`) get special handling;
a MotionValue passed as any other SVG attribute is spread raw onto the element and
stringifies as `[object Object]`. Upstream also renders `attrX`/`attrY`/`attrScale`
as the SVG `x`/`y`/`scale` _attributes_ (distinct from the CSS transform), which we
don't support at all. This is a marquee Motion use case (SVG data viz, progress
indicators) and the gap makes the port look broken rather than incomplete.

## Current state

Relevant files:

- `src/lib/utils/svg.ts` — SVG helpers. Line 7 defines the entire special-cased
  attribute surface:
    ```ts
    // src/lib/utils/svg.ts:7
    export const SVG_PATH_PROPERTIES = new Set(['pathLength', 'pathOffset', 'pathSpacing'])
    ```
    Lines ~142-220 map path props to `stroke-dasharray`/`pathLength="1"` semantics.
- `src/lib/html/_MotionContainer.svelte` — the single motion-element container
  (~2400 lines; both HTML and SVG render through it).
    - Around line 1387, `svgEffect` (from `motion-dom`) is invoked **only** for the
      path props during path animations:
        ```ts
        // src/lib/html/_MotionContainer.svelte:~1387
        cleanupSVGPathAttributeEffect = svgEffect(path, values)
        ```
    - Around line 1470, all remaining props are spread raw into the rendered
      attributes — this is where a MotionValue-valued attribute leaks through
      unstringified:
        ```ts
        // src/lib/html/_MotionContainer.svelte:~1470
        const derivedAttrs = $derived<Record<string, unknown>>({
            ...(rest as Record<string, unknown>),
            ...
        ```
- `src/lib/types.ts` — `MotionProps`. No `attrX`/`attrY`/`attrScale` types exist.
- `src/lib/index.ts` — already exports `attrEffect`, `svgEffect`, `propEffect`,
  `styleEffect` (line ~44), so the underlying motion-dom machinery is available.

Upstream reference (for semantics, read before implementing):

- `~/Github/motion/packages/motion-dom/src/effects/svg/index.ts` — `addSVGValue`
  routes any non-path/attr key through style-vs-attribute detection.
- `~/Github/motion/packages/motion-dom/src/render/svg/utils/build-attrs.ts:23-25,82-85`
  — `attrX`/`attrY`/`attrScale` render as `x`/`y`/`scale` attributes.

Repo conventions:

- Svelte 5 runes throughout; effects that need teardown return a cleanup and are
  registered in `onMount`/`$effect` blocks — follow the existing
  `cleanupSVGPathAttributeEffect` pattern in `_MotionContainer.svelte`.
- Google-style JSDoc on all exported functions/types.
- MotionValue detection: use the existing `isMotionValue` helper from `motion-dom`
  (grep for current import sites in `src/lib/utils/` and match them).

## Scope

**In scope** (the only files you should modify/create):

- `src/lib/utils/svg.ts` (attribute classification helpers)
- `src/lib/utils/svg.spec.ts` (extend)
- `src/lib/html/_MotionContainer.svelte` (MotionValue-attr subscription + attrX/Y/Scale mapping)
- `src/lib/types.ts` (attrX/attrY/attrScale types)
- `src/routes/tests/svg/motion-value-attributes/+page.svelte` (create demo)
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` (link the demo)
- `e2e/svg/motion-value-attributes.spec.ts` (create)
- `docs/src/routes/docs/svg-animation/` + `docs/src/lib/examples/svg-animation/` +
  `docs/src/lib/docsNav.ts` (docs page — **required**, see Docs step)

**Out of scope** (do NOT touch, even though they look related):

- The path-drawing pipeline (`SVG_PATH_PROPERTIES` handling, `buildSVGPath` usage)
  — it is correct and covered by `e2e/motion/svg-path-length.test.ts`.
- `src/lib/utils/style.ts` / transform building — CSS transforms are not part of
  this plan; `attrX` is an _attribute_, not a transform channel.
- Drag/projection/AnimatePresence code paths in `_MotionContainer.svelte`.

## Git workflow

- Branch: `feat/svg-motion-value-attributes` (repo uses `feat/`/`fix/` prefixes —
  see `git log --oneline`: e.g. `feat(values): vanilla motion-value layer...`).
- Conventional commits, e.g. `feat(svg): bind MotionValues to SVG presentation attributes`.
- Do NOT push or open a PR; the maintainer signs off on live demos first
  (project convention).

## Steps

### Step 1: Classify SVG attribute props in `svg.ts`

Add to `src/lib/utils/svg.ts`:

- An `SVG_ATTRIBUTE_PROPERTIES` set covering the animatable keys upstream
  supports: `cx, cy, r, rx, ry, x, y, x1, y1, x2, y2, width, height, points, d,
offset, stopColor, stopOpacity, fillOpacity, strokeOpacity, strokeWidth,
viewBox` (cross-check against upstream `build-attrs.ts`/`camel-case-attrs.ts`
  and include what upstream includes — cite the upstream file in the JSDoc).
- **The set must also carry the kebab-case DOM spellings** of every hyphenated
  key — `stop-color, stop-opacity, fill-opacity, stroke-opacity, stroke-width,
stroke-dashoffset, stroke-dasharray` — or normalize the key before lookup.
  Upstream's list is React-facing; Svelte templates take the DOM spelling, so a
  user writes `<motion.circle stroke-width={mv}>`. A kebab key that misses the
  allowlist is never claimed out of the raw spread and renders
  `stroke-width="[object Object]"` — the exact bug this plan exists to kill.
  (`'stroke-width' in element.style` is `true` in Chromium, so once claimed it
  routes correctly through `svgEffect` with no extra work.)
- A helper `extractSVGMotionValueAttributes(rest: Record<string, unknown>)` that
  returns `{ motionValueAttrs, staticAttrs }` — splitting entries whose value is
  a MotionValue from plain values.
  **Do not rename `attrX`/`attrY`/`attrScale` on the MotionValue side.**
  `svgEffect` does its own `/^attr([A-Z])/` conversion
  (`effects/svg/index.ts:44-62`); pre-renaming `attrScale` → `scale` makes it hit
  the `key in element.style` branch and become a CSS style instead of an
  attribute. Expose the rename as a separate `resolveSVGAttrKey(key)` helper, and
  apply it only to **static** attr-prefixed props and to SSR output.

**Verify**: `pnpm test src/lib/utils/svg.spec.ts` → passes (write the unit tests
in the same step: classification incl. at least one kebab-case key, attrX→x
mapping via `resolveSVGAttrKey`, non-MotionValue passthrough).

### Step 2: Subscribe MotionValue attributes in `_MotionContainer.svelte`

In the SVG branch of `_MotionContainer.svelte`:

1. Before the `derivedAttrs` spread (~line 1470), strip MotionValue-valued
   attribute entries out of `rest` so they never reach the raw spread.
2. On mount (client only), call `svgEffect(element, motionValueAttrs)` for SVG
   elements (or `attrEffect` for the `attrX/attrY/attrScale`-mapped keys),
   following the existing `cleanupSVGPathAttributeEffect` register/cleanup
   pattern at ~line 1387. Re-run the effect if the identity of the MotionValue
   props changes (match how `styleEffect` subscriptions are managed — grep
   `styleEffect` in the file, ~line 617).
3. SSR: render the MotionValue's **current** value as the initial attribute so
   server output is correct and hydration doesn't flash (`[object Object]` must
   never appear in SSR output either). Emit the **DOM attribute name**: strip the
   `attr` prefix (`attrX` → `x`) and use the kebab spelling for hyphenated keys
   (`strokeDashoffset` → `stroke-dashoffset`). SVG attribute names are
   case-sensitive, so a `strokeDashoffset` attribute is inert and the value will
   flash on hydration. Style-routed keys (`cx`, `r`, …) SSR correctly as
   presentation attributes: the client-set CSS property simply wins afterwards.

**Verify**: `pnpm check` → 0 errors. Then the demo (Step 3) shows a moving circle.

### Step 3: Demo route + e2e

Create `src/routes/tests/svg/motion-value-attributes/+page.svelte`:

- A `<motion.circle>` whose `cx` is a `useSpring`/`useMotionValue` driven by a
  slider or button, and a progress ring whose `r`/`stroke-dashoffset` tracks a
  MotionValue. Link it from `src/routes/+page.svelte` (match existing link list).

Create `e2e/svg/motion-value-attributes.spec.ts` (model after an existing spec in
`e2e/svg/`):

- Assert the rendered value is numeric (never `[object Object]`).
- Mutate the MotionValue (click the button), poll the **bound channel**, assert it
  changes. Read the channel the key actually routes to — `getAttribute(key)` for
  `points`/`viewBox`/`x1..y2`/`attrX`/`attrY`/`attrScale`, and
  `getComputedStyle(el)[key]` for `cx`/`cy`/`r`/`x`/`y`/`width`/`height`/`d`/
  `stroke-*`. Polling `getAttribute('cx')` will never observe a change and the
  test will hang until timeout.
- Computed styles carry units (`getComputedStyle(el).strokeDashoffset` → `"12.5px"`).
  Parse with `parseFloat`, not `Number` — `Number("12.5px")` is `NaN`, and
  `expect(NaN).not.toBe(NaN)` **fails** because `toBe` is `Object.is`.
- The "plain numeric attribute stays static" assertion must read the same channel
  the live element uses; asserting `getAttribute('cx')` is unchanged passes
  vacuously even when the subscription is entirely broken.

**Verify**: `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/svg` → all pass.

### Step 4: Docs page (**required — docs update flagged for this item**)

- New docs page `docs/src/routes/docs/svg-animation/+page.svx` + `+page.ts`
  covering: MotionValue→attribute binding, path drawing (`pathLength`), and
  `attrX/attrY/attrScale`. Reusable example under
  `docs/src/lib/examples/svg-animation/`, example route under
  `docs/src/routes/examples/svg-animation/`, nav entry in
  `docs/src/lib/docsNav.ts`.
- Regenerate sitemap: `pnpm --filter docs sitemap:manifest`.
- Match the structure of an existing docs page, e.g.
  `docs/src/routes/docs/transform-template/`.

**Verify**: `pnpm --filter docs check` (or the docs build) → exit 0.

### Step 5: Full gates

**Verify**: `pnpm check && pnpm test` → exit 0; `trunk fmt && trunk check` →
clean; `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/svg` → pass.

## Test plan

- Unit (`src/lib/utils/svg.spec.ts`): attribute classification, **including at least
  one kebab-case key (`stroke-width`)**; attrX/attrY/attrScale → x/y/scale mapping
  via `resolveSVGAttrKey`; MotionValue-side keys stay un-renamed so `svgEffect` can
  route them; MotionValue extraction leaves static attrs untouched; path props are
  NOT claimed by the new set (no double handling); SSR helper emits DOM attribute
  names (`strokeDashoffset` → `stroke-dashoffset`, `attrX` → `x`).
- e2e (`e2e/svg/motion-value-attributes.spec.ts`): no `[object Object]` in DOM;
  **the bound channel updates** when the MotionValue changes (attribute for
  attr-routed keys, computed style for style-routed keys — see Step 3);
  SSR/hydration initial value correct (fetch the route server-side, assert the
  payload carries a numeric value).
- Cover at least one key from each channel, so a regression in either routing
  branch is caught: `attrX` (attribute) and `cx` (style).
- Pattern: model unit tests after existing `src/lib/utils/svg.spec.ts` blocks;
  e2e after `e2e/svg/` existing specs.

## Done criteria

- [ ] `pnpm check` exits 0
- [ ] `pnpm test` exits 0; new svg.spec.ts cases exist and pass
- [ ] `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/svg` exits 0 incl. new spec
- [ ] Demo route exists and is linked from `src/routes/+page.svelte`
- [ ] Docs page exists with nav entry; sitemap regenerated
- [ ] `git status` shows no modified files outside the in-scope list
- [ ] Batch README status row updated

## STOP conditions

Stop and report back (do not improvise) if:

- The excerpts in "Current state" don't match the live code (drift).
- `svgEffect`/`attrEffect` from `motion-dom` turn out not to handle a needed
  attribute (e.g. `points`) — report the gap instead of hand-rolling a writer.
- Subscribing attributes conflicts with the path-props pipeline on the same
  element (double writes to `stroke-dasharray`) — report with a failing test.
- Fixing SSR requires changes to `src/lib/utils/style.ts` or the HTML (non-SVG)
  branch — that's out of scope; report.

## Maintenance notes

- Future upstream versions may extend the attribute list — the JSDoc on
  `SVG_ATTRIBUTE_PROPERTIES` cites the upstream file to diff against.
- Reviewer should scrutinize: hydration behavior (no attribute flash), and that
  `<motion.circle cx={5}>` (plain number) still renders statically with zero
  subscription overhead.
- Deferred: MotionValue-driven `transform` attribute on SVG (upstream handles
  via transform box tricks); `useMotionValueEvent`-style attr listeners.

## Amendment — Upstream ruling on Step 2.3 SSR attribute casing (2026-07-09)

**Question put to the plan author**: Step 2.3 requires SSR to emit DOM
attribute names (`strokeDashoffset` → `stroke-dashoffset`), but naive
dash-casing breaks `viewBox` → `view-box` (inert). The executor gated
dash-casing on motion-dom's exported `camelCaseAttributes` set and pinned
tests for `viewBox` (unchanged), `strokeDashoffset` (kebab), and
`'stroke-width'` (untouched), plus an SSR e2e asserting the payload contains
`stroke-dashoffset="…"` and not `strokeDashoffset=`.

**Ruling: APPROVED — the gate is upstream's own mechanism, verbatim.**
Verified against `~/Github/motion` at v12.42.2:

1. **Write path** — `packages/motion-dom/src/render/svg/utils/render.ts:15-19`:
   every rendered SVG attr goes through
   `!camelCaseAttributes.has(key) ? camelToDash(key) : key`. Dash-case
   everything except the allowlist. This is the exact semantic Step 2.3's SSR
   emitter must mirror.
2. **The allowlist** — `packages/motion-dom/src/render/svg/utils/camel-case-attrs.ts:4-28`
   (**23 entries** — verified against both the source and the installed
   package's `camelCaseAttributes.size`; use 23 as the drift-check reference on
   version bumps): `viewBox`, `baseFrequency`, `numOctaves`, `stdDeviation`,
   `gradientTransform`, `pathLength`, `markerWidth/Height`,
   `keySplines`/`keyTimes`, `textLength`, …. It is a deliberate public export
   (`motion-dom/src/index.ts:302`, confirmed reachable at the installed
   version) — **import it; do not vendor a copy**, so upstream additions track
   automatically on version bumps. **`camelToDash` is likewise a public
   motion-dom export (verified on the installed package) — import it too;
   hand-rolling the dash-caser is the same vendoring mistake one function
   over.** Note the filter-primitive entries (`baseFrequency`, `numOctaves`,
   `stdDeviation`) are exactly what Plan 005's `feTurbulence` work will drive
   through this path.
3. **Already-kebab keys are safe by construction** —
   `packages/motion-dom/src/render/dom/utils/camel-to-dash.ts` is a pure
   uppercase-letter replacer; `'stroke-width'` passes through unchanged. The
   pinned test matches upstream behavior.
4. **NEW NORMATIVE REQUIREMENT — gate ordering vs `attr` prefix.** The casing
   gate MUST run **after** `resolveSVGAttrKey` strips the `attr` prefix, never
   before. `attrX` is not in `camelCaseAttributes`, so gating it first emits
   the inert attribute `attr-x` instead of `x` (probed on the installed
   package: `attrX → attr-x`, `attrScale → attr-scale`). This is upstream's
   own ordering: `buildSVGAttrs`
   (`packages/motion-dom/src/render/svg/utils/build-attrs.ts:23-25,82-85`)
   destructures `attrX/attrY/attrScale` into `attrs.x/y/scale` _before_
   `renderSVG` ever applies the gate. Both orderings pass a naive
   `strokeDashoffset` test, so this needs its own unit case:
   `attrX` through resolve-then-gate → `x` (and never `attr-x`).
5. **Read-path symmetry (conditional).** Upstream applies the _same_ gate
   before reading: `packages/motion-dom/src/render/svg/SVGVisualElement.ts:39`
   runs the gate before `instance.getAttribute(key)`. **This plan's current
   scope has no attribute read-back path** (the only SVG-attribute
   `getAttribute` calls in `src/lib/` are hardcoded kebab strings in the
   path pipeline, `_MotionContainer.svelte:882,888`, out of scope here) — so
   no read-back code or test is required. The requirement is conditional: IF
   the implementation introduces any attribute read-back (initial-value
   resolution, SSR/hydration reconciliation), it MUST apply the identical
   gate, after `attr`-prefix resolution per point 4, or a value written as
   `stroke-dashoffset` read back via `getAttribute('strokeDashoffset')`
   returns `null`. Do not build a read-back path just to satisfy this point.

Context: upstream never needs this conversion in its _React SSR_ path because
React JSX normalizes SVG attribute casing at the framework layer; motion-dom's
imperative `renderSVG` is the upstream analogue of our Svelte SSR emitter, so
its semantics are the correct reference.

**Correction record (v2, 2026-07-09, same day):** the guard verified the v1
ruling and found three defects, all confirmed by the plan author against
source and the installed package before this revision: (a) the allowlist has
23 entries, not 26 as v1 stated; (b) v1 omitted that `camelToDash` is itself
a public export — now in point 2; (c) v1 missed the gate-vs-`attr`-prefix
ordering hazard — now normative point 4 with its own unit case; and v1's
read-path requirement mandated a unit test for a read-back path that does not
exist in scope — now conditional point 5. Points 1-3's citations were
verified exact by the guard.

— _Ruled by the plan author (Claude Fable 5, advisor session of 2026-07-08/09),
against upstream source `~/Github/motion` v12.42.2, at maintainer request;
v2 corrections adopted after independent guard verification. The guard should
treat points 1-3 as confirmation of the executor's current implementation,
point 4 as a new requirement (with unit case) to verify before DONE, and
point 5 as conditional-only._
